Customer Segmentation: The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, using clustering techniques. This segmentation will help identify different customer types with similar purchasing patterns.

Use of Clustering Techniques: Various clustering algorithms (such as K-Means, Gaussian Mixtures, or DBSCAN) will be applied to analyze customer data and create distinct groups, allowing for a better understanding of the diversity in customer behaviours.

Targeted Marketing: By identifying these customer segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to each specific group, ensuring more personalized and effective communication.

Improved Decision-Making: The insights gained from the segmentation will assist businesses in making data-driven decisions about product offerings, promotions, and customer engagement strategies.
